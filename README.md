# modsunder25k

While developing [Pinky's Peculiar Pack](https://github.com/pinkygrocket/pinkys-peculiar-pack), I've been doing a lot of digging through the depths of CurseForge, and have found some pretty cool mods that have been overlooked or just really haven't had their chance to shine. I've created lists and shouted out mods in various places, but I'm creating a list as a GitHub repo - both as a central public place to manage this list and to make this list into a community resource that others can contribute to.

Suggest mods to add or changes on the issues page.

# Inclusion criteria

* The mod must be below 25,000 downloads. For mods posted on both Curseforge and Modrinth, this is not cumulative across sites. However, it is cumulative across different listings on the same site- e.g. seperate posts for Forge and Fabric. I may make a "Scaled Out" section for mods that have grown too large to include on the main list, but were included in the past.
* Ideally, the mod should be posted on CurseForge or Modrinth. No mods hosted by mirror/repost sites. I may post mods from other sites under certain circumstances, if they were posted by the author.
* No mods made with MCreator.
* No mods created for hacking, cheating, or piracy.
* Mod must be available in English.
* Mod must be available for public download.
