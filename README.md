While developing [Pinky's Peculiar Pack](https://github.com/pinkygrocket/pinkys-peculiar-pack), I've been doing a lot of digging through the depths of CurseForge, and have found some pretty cool mods that have been overlooked or just really haven't had their chance to shine. I've created lists and shouted out mods in various places, but I'm creating a list as a GitHub repo - both as a central public place to manage this list and to accept contributions/suggestions from others.

Suggest mods to add or changes on the issues page.

# Inclusion criteria

* Ideally, the mod should be posted on CurseForge or Modrinth. No mods hosted by mirror/repost sites. I may post mods from other sites under certain circumstances, if they were posted by the author.
* No mods made with MCreator.
* No mods created for hacking, cheating, or piracy.
* Mod must be available in English.
* Mod must be available for public download.

## Modloader

Self-explanatory. While most Fabric mods work with Quilt, Quilt is not tagged unless it is specifically noted on the mod's page. The same applies to NeoForge for 1.20.1 and below.

* **Forge**
* **Fabric**
* **NeoForge**
* **Quilt**

## Source availability

If conflicting licenses for a mod are listed on Curseforge/Modrinth/Github, the one on Curseforge/Modrinth takes priority.

* **Source-available** - The mod's source code is publicly available and is licensed under [a license that falls under source-available.](https://fossid.com/articles/source-available-101-how-to-counter-this-confusing-license-category/), excluding the license used for assets.
* **Closed-source** - The mod's source code is not publicly available.

## Needed on

If no "needed-on" tag is listed, then the mod is required both client-side and server-side.

* **Client-only** - This mod is only needed on the client and will cause issues if installed on the server.
* **Server-only** - This mod is only needed on the server and will cause issues if installed on the client.
