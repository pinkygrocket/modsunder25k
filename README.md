# modsunder25k

While developing [Pinky's Peculiar Pack](https://github.com/pinkygrocket/pinkys-peculiar-pack), I've been doing a lot of digging through the depths of CurseForge, and have found some pretty cool mods that have been overlooked or just really haven't had their chance to shine. I've created lists and shouted out mods in various places, but I'm creating a list as a GitHub repo - both as a central public place to manage this list and to accept contributions/suggestions from others.

Suggest mods to add or changes on the issues page.
